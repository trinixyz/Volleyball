 <p>Place of birth:Inabe</p>

 <h2>ELEMENATRY SCHOOL YEARS</h2>

 <p>Nishida first started playing volleyball due to his elder sister and brother both playing the game, and joined the same team as his brother, the "Daian Beetles."</p>
 <p>While being fascinated by the Olympics, his attention was caught by Kunihiro Shimizu, a left-handed "opposite" like him who inspired him to want to compete in the Olympics.</p>
 <p>In his fourth year of elementary school, Nishida achieved a huge goal of winning the 29th All Japan Volleyball Tournament in Mie Prefecture.</p>
 <p>In his sixth year of elementary school, he became the captain and led the team to win the President's Cup of Mie Prefecture Club Volleyball Federation</p>

 <h2>MIDDLE SCHOOL YEARS</h2>

 <p>After graduation, he went to a local junior high (middle school) which was not a powerhouse.</p>
 <p>Nishida had the opportunity to participate in Kaisei High School's volleyball club practice in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture as he was a regular player since freshman year. His play there caught the attention of Masanobu Onishi, the volleyball team manager at that time, and Katsunari Fujita, the head of the team. In June of the same year, he joined the junior high school club team 'NFO Ocean Star', recommended by Fujita.</p>
 <p>In March 2013, Nishida was selected for the U-14 team in the Hokusei district of Mie Prefecture. In August of the same year, he was selected for the Mie Prefecture selection team and competed with teams from all over Japan in the Junior Olympic Cup held in December.</p>

 <h2>HIGH SCHOOL YEARS</h2>

 <p>He chose to decline the powerhouses in his prefectures and chose to go to Kaisei High School which had never qualified for the national volleyball tournament.[15] He later joined the newly established U-19 of the local club team Vertian Mie. In June, they won the U-19 boys division of the Mie Prefecture Young Volleyball Championship, and in September, they won the national championship. Nishida received the Japan Young Club Volleyball Federation Award as an outstanding player in that tournament.</p>
 <p>Just as he had done in junior high school, Nishida practiced with three different teams and went on to compete in the Mie Prefectural High School Championship (Haruko Preliminaries) in November.[16]</p>
